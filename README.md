# Motion Tracked Dance Game 

#For my final project I tried to create an interactive dance game using unity & the Qualysis motion tracking system. In the game the user is given 3 song options to choose from before the game starts, and then they are loaded into the scene corresponding to their song selection. The player is given 60 seconds to "dance" around and collect as many gems as they can to the song that they chose. After that a screen is displayed indicating the end of the game. 
The Qualiysis tracking system was used to track the headset that the user wears, which controls the body of the dancer in the game. Homemade tracking braceletes are then worn on the corresponding wrist which allows you to control the arms of the dancer. The user has to waive their head and arms around in order to collect gems and increase their score. These motions & the music playing along with the retro asthetic of the game was intended to create a pretty funky experience that invites the user to dance around.
